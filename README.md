# Handwriting_Classification
My first use of ML and Tensorflow.
This program uses the mnist data set which is a voluminous and publicly available data set.
The Ann has three layers, the first two both have 64 neurons and use the 'relu' function. 
The third has 10 neurons and uses the softmax function.
I used this project as my introduction to ML and Ann. I the programme works as intended.
